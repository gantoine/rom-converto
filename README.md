## Supported consoles and formats

| Console or media | Main operations |
|---|---|
| Nintendo DS | Encrypt and decrypt NDS ROMs |
| Nintendo 3DS | Encrypt, decrypt, and convert CIA/CCI; compress decrypted ROMs to Z3DS; build CIA from CDN content |
| GameCube | Compress ISO/GCM to RVZ; migrate GCZ and NKit to RVZ; decompress RVZ |
| Wii | Compress ISO/WBFS to RVZ; migrate GCZ, WIA, and NKit to RVZ; decompress RVZ |
| Wii U | Pack NUS, loadiine, WUD, or WUX into WUA; decrypt NUS to a game folder |
| Nintendo Switch | Compress NSP/XCI to NSZ/XCZ and decompress them; merge or split unpacked NSP/XCI; decrypt NSP/XCI to NxEmu DNSP/DXCI |
| CD / DVD | Compress CUE/BIN or ISO to CHD; migrate CHD v1 to v4 into v5; extract CHD; merge CUE/BIN tracks |
| LaserDisc | Compress AVI to CHD |
| PSP / PS2 | Compress ISO to CSO/ZSO; decompress CSO/ZSO/DAX; convert between these and CHD |
| PSP | Extract EBOOT.PBP and PKG; convert supported packages to ISO |
| PS Vita | Extract PKG files |
| Xbox | Convert a disc image or game folder to XISO; extract disc files |
| Xbox 360 | Pack a disc image or game folder into ZAR; convert a disc ISO to GoD; extract ZAR files |
| PlayStation 3 | Decrypt disc ISOs |

`info` also inspects PSP, PS Vita, PS3, PS4, and PS5 packages, and classic cartridge ROMs. Inspection support does not imply conversion support. See [formats and compatibility](docs/formats.md) for extensions, limits, and emulator guidance.

`organize` sorts a whole library folder into per-console folders and converts each
file to the best archival format for its console. See [CLI reference](docs/cli.md#organize).

**Preview first:** add `--dry-run` to a conversion to see planned outputs. Use `-R` (`--recursive`) on commands that support folder scans.

## Install

Download the CLI or desktop app for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/DevYukine/rom-converto/releases/latest). CLI releases are standalone binaries. Rename yours to `rom-converto` (`rom-converto.exe` on Windows) and add its folder to your `PATH`. On Linux and macOS, run `chmod +x rom-converto` first.

```sh
rom-converto --version
rom-converto --help
```

Switch conversions need `prod.keys`. Wii U and PS3 disc operations resolve disc keys automatically where possible. See [key setup](docs/configuration.md).

## Quick start

Compress one GameCube image, or preview a whole folder:

```sh
rom-converto dol compress game.iso
rom-converto dol compress -R ./games --output-dir ./rvz --dry-run
```

Run the batch after reviewing the preview:

```sh
rom-converto dol compress -R ./games --output-dir ./rvz
```

Other common tasks:

```sh
# Restore an RVZ to ISO
rom-converto dol decompress game.rvz

# Decrypt a 3DS ROM
rom-converto ctr decrypt game.cia

# Compress a Switch game
rom-converto nx compress game.nsp --keys prod.keys

# Inspect a file
rom-converto info game.iso

# Hash a folder and save the results
rom-converto hash -R ./games --report hashes.csv

# Sort a library into per-console folders
rom-converto organize ./library --output-dir ./sorted --dry-run
```

Most conversions derive the output name from the input. Use an explicit output path or `--output-dir` where supported.

### Useful options

| Option | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Preview a conversion, rename, or playlist operation before running it |
| `-R`, `--recursive` | Process matching files in a folder and its subfolders |
| `--max-depth 1` | Limit a supported folder scan to the top level |
| `--output-dir ./converted` | Choose an output folder |
| `--on-conflict skip` | Keep existing outputs and skip those files |
| `-f`, `--force` | Overwrite existing outputs |
| `--report run.json` | Save results as JSON, CSV, or HTML, based on the extension |
| `--config settings.toml`, `--preset fast` | Reuse defaults and named settings |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show options for the selected command |

Options vary by command. Check `rom-converto dol compress --help`, for example. Dry runs can still read inputs, contact services, and write requested logs or reports; see [CLI behavior](docs/cli.md).

## Development

Build the CLI with a current stable Rust toolchain:

```sh
cargo build --release -p rom-converto-cli
```

The binary is `target/release/rom-converto` (`rom-converto.exe` on Windows). Desktop development also uses Node.js 22 and pnpm. See [development setup](docs/development.md) for platform dependencies and checks.

### Built with

- **Rust** for conversion logic, a **Clap** CLI, and **Tokio** for asynchronous work.
- **Tauri 2**, **Nuxt 4 / Vue**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Pinia** for the desktop app.
- **RustCrypto** crates for encryption and hashing; **Zstandard**, **LZMA**, **zlib**, and other codecs for format-specific compression.
- A shared Rust library used by the CLI, desktop app, and C API.

### Benchmarks

See results for [3DS](benchmark/3DS.md), [GameCube](benchmark/GameCube.md), [Wii](benchmark/Wii.md), [Switch](benchmark/Switch.md), and [CHD](benchmark/CHD.md). [Development](docs/development.md) covers how to reproduce them.
